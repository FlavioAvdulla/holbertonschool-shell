# I/O Redirection


- What do the commands `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr` do
- How to redirect standard output to a file
- How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
- How to send the output from one program to the input of another program
- How to combine commands and filters with redirections


In this lesson, we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection. As we have seen, many commands such as **ls** print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.

## Standard Output

Most command line programs that display their results do so by sending their results to a facility called standard output. By default, standard output directs its contents to the display. To redirect standard output to a file, the ">" character is used like this:
`[me@linuxbox me]$ ls > file_list.txt`

In this example, the **ls** command is executed and the results are written in a file named file_list.txt. Since the output of **ls** was redirected to the file, no results appear on the display.

Each time the command above is repeated, file_list.txt is overwritten from the beginning with the output of the command ls. To have the new results appended to the file instead, we use ">>" like this:
`[me@linuxbox me]$ls >> file_list.txt`

When the results are appended, the new results are added to the end of the file, thus making the file longer each time the command is repeated. If the file does not exist when we attempt to append the redirected output, the file will be created.

## Standard Input

Many commands can accept input from a facility called *standard input.* By default, standard input gets its contents from the keyboard, but like standard output, it can be redirected. To redirect standard input from a file instead of the keyboard, the "<" character is used like this:
`[me@linuxbox me]$ sort < file_list.txt`

In the example above, we used the [sort](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/sort1.html) command to process the contents of file_list.txt. The results are output on the display since the standard output was not redirected. We could redirect standard output to another file like this:
`[me@linuxbox me]$ sort < file_list.txt > sorted_file_list.txt`

As we can see, a command can have both its input and output redirected. Be aware that the order of the redirection does not matter. The only requirement is that the redirection operators (the "<" and ">") must appear after the other options and arguments in the command.

## Pipelines

The most useful and powerful thing we can do with I/O redirection is to connect multiple commands together to form what are called pipelines. With pipelines, the standard output of one command is fed into the standard input of another. Here is a very useful example:
`[me@linuxbox me]$ ls -l | less`

In this example, the output of the **ls** command is fed into less. By using this **"| less"** trick, we can make any command have scrolling output.
